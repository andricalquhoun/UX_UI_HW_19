                <p id="paragraph">I have always been an avid epicurean traveler since my dad introduced me to the lifestyle, I have always wanted to connect with other like myself so exploring this idea more in depth opened my mind to the need of an application that allows travelers like my self to locate locations that are non tourist traps. 

                    My initial hypothesis was that travelers wanted a less overwhelming way of locating food while on the road, something similar to Yelp. Interestingly enough I ended up with a food travel app that is more closely related to a form of social media like Instagram. Read more of my case study to find out  how I got to this point!

                 <p id="paragraph">When choosing which non-profit organization’s website my team should redesign, we discussed several potential outlets but ultimately came to the agreement that we should put our efforts towards a cause we all felt strongly about, in this case children diagnosed with cancer. 

                    Our initial hypothesis was that parents would be our primary user for this site, but after talking to our stakeholder we immediately found out that donors are their main target. After this realisation we immediately pivoted our design thinking. Read more on how my team and I worked through several research and iterations to get to the final product!</p>
